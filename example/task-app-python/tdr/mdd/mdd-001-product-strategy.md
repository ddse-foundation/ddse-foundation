# MDD-001: Product Strategy and Constraints

## Status
**Accepted** - January 15, 2025

## Context

TaskFlow addresses the need for simple task management in small development teams without the complexity overhead of enterprise project management tools. The product strategy focuses on rapid deployment, minimal learning curve, and essential functionality.

### Market Position
- **Target Market**: Small development teams (2-10 members)
- **Competitive Advantage**: Simplicity and speed over feature richness
- **Success Metric**: Teams operational within 5 minutes of setup

### Business Constraints
- **Development Resources**: Single developer implementation
- **Timeline**: 2-3 days for MVP delivery
- **Infrastructure**: Standard web hosting, no specialized services
- **Budget**: Minimal operational costs

## Decision

**We will build TaskFlow as a minimal viable task management API focused on essential functionality rather than comprehensive feature coverage.**

### Strategic Choices

1. **Simplicity Over Features**
   - Prioritize core task CRUD operations
   - Exclude advanced project management features (gantt charts, time tracking, reporting)
   - Avoid complex workflow management and approval processes
   - No custom fields or extensive configuration options

2. **Speed Over Scalability**
   - Optimize for fast development and deployment
   - Accept initial scaling limitations (10 users max)
   - Plan incremental scaling as needed
   - Choose proven, simple technologies over cutting-edge solutions

3. **API-First Architecture**
   - Design as RESTful API to support multiple client types
   - Self-documenting API with OpenAPI specification
   - Stateless design for simple deployment and scaling

4. **Zero-Configuration Deployment**
   - Single file database (SQLite)
   - No external dependencies beyond Python runtime
   - Environment-agnostic design

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Rapid Time-to-Market**: 2-3 day development timeline achievable
- **Low Operational Overhead**: Minimal infrastructure and maintenance requirements
- **High Developer Productivity**: Simple codebase easy to understand and modify
- **Clear Value Proposition**: Focused feature set with obvious benefits

### Negative
- **Limited Scalability**: Cannot support large teams (>10 users) initially
- **Feature Gaps**: Missing advanced project management capabilities
- **Competitive Risk**: Larger solutions may offer more comprehensive features
- **Growth Constraints**: May need significant rework for enterprise features

### Risks
- **Market Validation**: Assumption that simplicity is valued over features
- **Technical Debt**: Rapid development may create maintenance challenges
- **Scope Creep**: Pressure to add features may compromise simplicity

## Implementation Guidance

### Development Priorities
1. Core task management (CRUD operations)
2. User authentication and team-based access
3. RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
4. Basic deployment packaging

### Excluded Features (For Now)
- Real-time collaboration
- File attachments
- Advanced search and filtering
- Integration with external tools
- Custom workflows
- Reporting and analytics

## Success Metrics
- **Time to First Task**: User can create first task within 2 minutes
- **API Response Time**: All endpoints respond within 200ms
- **Deployment Simplicity**: Single developer can deploy in under 30 minutes
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults

## Review Schedule
This decision should be reviewed after MVP completion and initial user feedback.
