# TaskFlow Project Overview

## Project Context

**Project Name**: TaskFlow  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Owner**: Development Team  
**Type**: Task Management API  

## Business Requirements

### Target Users
- Small development teams (2-10 members)
- Teams needing simple task coordination without complexity overhead
- Organizations wanting fast deployment and minimal learning curve

### Core Value Proposition
- **Simplicity First**: Focus on essential task management features
- **Fast Onboarding**: Team can start using within 5 minutes
- **Developer Friendly**: RESTful API with clear documentation
- **Minimal Overhead**: Lightweight deployment and maintenance

### Success Criteria
1. **Time to First Task**: User can create first task within 2 minutes
2. **API Response Time**: All endpoints respond within 200ms
3. **Deployment Simplicity**: Single developer can deploy in under 30 minutes
4. **Zero Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults

## Technical Constraints

### Development Constraints
- **Team Size**: Implementation by single developer
- **Timeline**: 2-3 days for MVP
- **Skill Level**: Standard web development skills (no specialized expertise)

### Operational Constraints
- **Infrastructure**: Must run on commodity hardware
- **Database**: No complex database setup required
- **Scaling**: Support up to 10 concurrent users initially
- **Backup**: Simple file-based backup strategy

### Integration Requirements
- **Frontend Flexibility**: API-first design for multiple client types
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting API (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- **Testing**: Automated testing strategy for core functionality

## Core Functionality

### MVP Features
1. **User Management**
   - User registration and authentication
   - Basic profile management
   - Team member invitation

2. **Task Management**
   - Create, read, update, delete tasks
   - Task assignment to team members
   - Priority levels (low, medium, high)
   - Status tracking (todo, in_progress, completed)
   - Due date management

3. **Basic Filtering**
   - Filter tasks by status
   - Filter tasks by assigned user
   - Filter tasks by priority

### Excluded from MVP
- Complex project management features
- Time tracking
- Advanced reporting
- File attachments
- Real-time notifications
- Complex workflow management

## Quality Attributes

### Performance
- **Response Time**: < 200ms for all API endpoints
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 10 simultaneous users
- **Data Volume**: Handle up to 1,000 tasks per team

### Reliability
- **Uptime**: 99% availability during business hours
- **Data Integrity**: No task data loss
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of common error scenarios

### Security
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication
- **Authorization**: Users can only access their team's tasks
- **Data Protection**: Secure storage of user credentials

### Usability
- **API Clarity**: Intuitive endpoint naming and structure
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error descriptions
- **Documentation**: Complete API documentation with examples

## Technical Approach

### Development Philosophy
- **Decision-First**: Document architectural choices before implementation
- **AI-Assisted**: Use AI tools with human-defined constraints
- **Iterative**: Build incrementally with regular validation

### Technology Preferences
- **Language**: Python (team expertise)
- **Framework**: FastAPI (automatic documentation, modern async support)
- **Database**: SQLite (zero configuration, sufficient for scale)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens (stateless, scalable)

## Risk Factors

### Technical Risks
- **Over-Engineering**: Risk of adding unnecessary complexity
- **Under-Documentation**: Risk of insufficient decision documentation
- **Scope Creep**: Risk of feature expansion beyond MVP

### Mitigation Strategies
- **DDSE Methodology**: Document all significant decisions
- **Regular Reviews**: Sprint-level decision review
- **Strict Scope**: Maintain focus on MVP features only

## Success Metrics

### Development Metrics
- **Decision Coverage**: All architectural choices documented in TDRs
- **Implementation Alignment**: Code follows documented decisions
- **AI Effectiveness**: AI-generated code requires minimal human correction

### Product Metrics
- **User Adoption**: Team starts using within first week
- **Task Creation Rate**: Average 5+ tasks created per user per week
- **Error Rate**: < 1% API error rate during normal usage
