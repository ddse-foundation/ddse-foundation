# ADR-001: REST API Architecture

## Status
**Accepted** - January 15, 2025

## Context

TaskFlow requires an API architecture that supports the product strategy defined in MDD-001. The architecture must enable:

- Multiple client types (web, mobile, CLI)
- Rapid development within 2-3 day constraint
- Simple deployment and maintenance
- Clear, self-documenting interface

### Technical Context
- **Development Team**: Single developer with standard web development skills
- **Infrastructure Constraint**: Standard web hosting environment
- **Client Requirements**: Support for future web and mobile applications
- **Timeline Pressure**: Architecture choice must not delay implementation

### Integration Requirements
- **Frontend Flexibility**: Multiple client implementations over time
- **API Documentation**: Self-generating documentation for developer onboarding
- **Testing Strategy**: Automated testing of API endpoints
- **Development Tools**: Standard tooling compatibility

## Decision

**We will implement TaskFlow using RESTful API architecture with JSON request/response format and automatic OpenAPI documentation generation.**

### Architectural Choices

1. **RESTful Design Principles**
   - Resource-based URL structure
   - HTTP verbs for operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Stateless communication
   - Standard HTTP status codes

2. **JSON Data Format**
   - Request and response bodies in JSON
   - Consistent error response structure
   - UTF-8 encoding for internationalization support

3. **OpenAPI Integration**
   - Automatic documentation generation
   - Interactive API testing interface
   - Schema validation for requests/responses

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: GraphQL API
- **Pros**: Flexible querying, efficient data fetching, strong typing
- **Cons**: Higher learning curve, more complex implementation, overkill for simple CRUD
- **Rejection Reason**: Conflicts with rapid development constraint and team skill alignment

### Alternative 2: gRPC API
- **Pros**: High performance, strong typing, efficient serialization
- **Cons**: Limited web browser support, requires specialized tooling, steeper learning curve
- **Rejection Reason**: Does not support web client requirement without additional complexity

### Alternative 3: Server-Side Rendered Web Application
- **Pros**: Simpler overall architecture, single technology stack
- **Cons**: Tight coupling between frontend and backend, limited client flexibility
- **Rejection Reason**: Conflicts with API-first strategy from MDD-001

## Rationale

REST API architecture aligns with all strategic constraints:

1. **Rapid Development**: Well-established patterns and extensive tooling support
2. **Developer Familiarity**: Standard REST concepts reduce learning overhead
3. **Client Flexibility**: Enables multiple frontend implementations
4. **Documentation**: Automatic OpenAPI generation reduces documentation burden
5. **Testing**: Standard HTTP testing tools and frameworks available

### Supporting Technology Alignment
- **FastAPI Framework**: Automatic OpenAPI generation, async support, Python ecosystem
- **Standard Tooling**: Works with all standard HTTP testing and monitoring tools
- **Deployment Simplicity**: Compatible with all standard hosting environments

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Fast Implementation**: Leverage existing REST patterns and tooling
- **Clear Interface Contracts**: OpenAPI specification provides unambiguous API definition
- **Frontend Independence**: Multiple client implementations without backend changes
- **Standard Tooling**: Use industry-standard testing, monitoring, and documentation tools
- **Developer Onboarding**: Well-known patterns reduce learning curve for future developers

### Negative Consequences
- **Over-fetching**: REST may require multiple requests for complex data relationships
- **Version Management**: API versioning strategy required for future changes
- **Caching Complexity**: Stateless nature may require additional caching strategy

### Risk Mitigation
- **Simple Data Model**: TaskFlow's simple entities minimize over-fetching concerns
- **Version Strategy**: Plan API versioning approach before first client implementation
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed data

## Implementation Guidelines

### URL Structure Standards
```
GET    /tasks              # List all tasks
POST   /tasks              # Create new task
GET    /tasks/{id}         # Get specific task
PUT    /tasks/{id}         # Update entire task
DELETE /tasks/{id}         # Delete task

GET    /users              # List team members
POST   /users              # Create user account
GET    /users/{id}         # Get user profile
PUT    /users/{id}         # Update user profile
```

### Response Format Standards
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "task-123",
    "title": "Example Task",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "api_version": "1.0"
  }
}
```

### Error Response Standards
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Task title is required",
    "details": {
      "field": "title",
      "constraint": "min_length_1"
    }
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "request_id": "req-789"
  }
}
```

## AI Assistant Context

```yaml
ai_context:
  framework_guidance: |
    Use FastAPI for automatic OpenAPI documentation and async support.
    Implement the following patterns:
    - Resource-based routing with APIRouter
    - Pydantic models for request/response validation
    - Dependency injection for common functionality
    - Automatic HTTP status code handling
  
  url_design_patterns: |
    Follow RESTful conventions:
    - Plural nouns for resource collections (/tasks, /users)
    - HTTP verbs for operations (GET list, POST create, PUT update, DELETE remove)
    - Path parameters for resource identification (/tasks/{task_id})
    - Query parameters for filtering and pagination (?status=completed&limit=20)
  
  response_patterns: |
    Maintain consistent response structure:
    - Wrap data in "data" field for successful responses
    - Include "meta" field with timestamp and version info
    - Use "error" field for error responses with structured details
    - Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
  
  validation_requirements: |
    - Use Pydantic models for automatic request validation
    - Return 422 for validation errors with detailed field information
    - Implement custom validators for business rules
    - Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks
  
  documentation_requirements: |
    - Use FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI generation
    - Add detailed docstrings to all endpoint functions
    - Include example requests and responses in docstrings
    - Provide clear error code documentation
```

## Compliance Rules

### Code Structure Requirements
- All endpoints must use FastAPI router patterns
- Request/response models must be defined using Pydantic
- Error handling must follow documented response format
- OpenAPI documentation must be complete and accurate

### Performance Requirements
- All endpoints must respond within 200ms under normal load
- Implement async/await patterns for database operations
- Use connection pooling for database access
- Include response time monitoring

### Security Requirements
- All endpoints must validate input using Pydantic models
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Use HTTPS in production deployment
- Sanitize all user input to prevent injection attacks
