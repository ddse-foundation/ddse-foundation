# MDD-001: Product Strategy and Constraints

## Status
**Accepted** - January 15, 2025

## Context

TaskFlow addresses the need for simple task management in small development teams without the complexity overhead of enterprise project management tools. The product strategy focuses on rapid deployment, minimal learning curve, and essential functionality.

### Market Position
- **Target Market**: Small development teams (2-10 members)
- **Competitive Advantage**: Simplicity and speed over feature richness
- **Success Metric**: Teams operational within 5 minutes of setup

### Business Constraints
- **Development Resources**: Single developer implementation
- **Timeline**: 2-3 days for MVP delivery
- **Infrastructure**: Standard web hosting, no specialized services
- **Budget**: Minimal operational costs

## Decision

**We will build TaskFlow as a minimal viable task management API focused on essential functionality rather than comprehensive feature coverage.**

### Strategic Choices

1. **Simplicity Over Features**
   - Prioritize core task CRUD operations
   - Exclude advanced project management features
   - Avoid complex workflow management

2. **Speed Over Scalability**
   - Optimize for fast development and deployment
   - Accept initial scaling limitations (10 users max)
   - Plan incremental scaling as needed

3. **API-First Architecture**
   - Enable multiple frontend implementations
   - Support web, mobile, and CLI clients
   - Maintain frontend flexibility

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Comprehensive Project Management Tool
- **Pros**: Feature completeness, market differentiation
- **Cons**: Increased complexity, longer development time, higher maintenance burden
- **Rejection Reason**: Conflicts with rapid delivery constraint

### Alternative 2: Integration with Existing Tools
- **Pros**: Leverage existing functionality, faster time to market
- **Cons**: Dependency on external services, reduced control, integration complexity
- **Rejection Reason**: Does not align with simplicity goal

### Alternative 3: Desktop Application
- **Pros**: Native performance, offline capability
- **Cons**: Platform-specific development, deployment complexity, reduced accessibility
- **Rejection Reason**: API-first approach provides more flexibility

## Rationale

The decision prioritizes rapid market validation over feature completeness. By focusing on essential task management functionality, we can:

1. **Validate Core Value Proposition**: Determine if simple task management meets user needs
2. **Minimize Development Risk**: Reduce technical complexity and implementation time
3. **Enable Iterative Enhancement**: Build foundation for future feature additions
4. **Optimize Resource Utilization**: Align with single-developer constraint

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Fast Time to Market**: MVP delivery within 2-3 days
- **Low Technical Risk**: Simple architecture reduces failure probability
- **Clear Scope Boundaries**: Well-defined feature limitations prevent scope creep
- **Resource Efficiency**: Minimal infrastructure and development overhead

### Negative Consequences
- **Limited Market Appeal**: May not satisfy users needing advanced features
- **Competitive Vulnerability**: Simple feature set may be easily replicated
- **Growth Constraints**: Architecture may require redesign for significant scaling

### Risk Mitigation
- **Market Validation**: Early user feedback to validate simplicity approach
- **Incremental Development**: Plan feature additions based on user demand
- **Architecture Evolution**: Design for extensibility within simplicity constraints

## Compliance Requirements

### Architectural Alignment
- All architectural decisions must support rapid development goal
- Technology choices must prioritize developer productivity
- Infrastructure decisions must minimize operational complexity

### Implementation Guidelines
- Feature additions require explicit business value justification
- New functionality must maintain API simplicity
- Performance optimizations must not compromise code clarity

## AI Assistant Context

```yaml
ai_context:
  product_strategy: |
    TaskFlow is designed for simplicity and speed over feature richness.
    Every implementation decision should prioritize:
    1. Fast development and deployment
    2. Minimal learning curve for users
    3. Essential functionality only
    4. API-first architecture for flexibility
  
  constraint_enforcement: |
    - Reject suggestions that add complexity without clear value
    - Prioritize standard, well-established patterns
    - Avoid features that require specialized infrastructure
    - Maintain focus on 2-3 day implementation timeline
  
  business_rules: |
    - Target users: Small teams (2-10 people)
    - Maximum development time: 2-3 days
    - Maximum concurrent users: 10 initially
    - Zero configuration deployment preferred
  
  success_criteria: |
    - User can create first task within 2 minutes
    - Team operational within 5 minutes of setup
    - All API responses under 200ms
    - Single developer can deploy in 30 minutes
```
