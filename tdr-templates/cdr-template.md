    limit: 100
    window: "1h"
    per: "user"
```

## Implementation Requirements

### Backend Implementation
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Validation**: Use Joi or Yup for request validation
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- **Logging**: Log all API requests with correlation IDs
- **Testing**: Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints

### Frontend Integration
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with TypeScript types generated from OpenAPI spec
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling and user feedback
- **Caching**: Implement appropriate caching strategy for GET endpoints
- **Loading States**: Proper loading and error states for all API calls

### Testing Requirements
- **Contract Testing**: Use Pact or similar for consumer-driven contract testing
- **API Testing**: Comprehensive test suite covering all endpoints and error cases
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for critical endpoints
- **Security Testing**: Automated security scanning of API endpoints

## Evolution Strategy

### Versioning Approach
- **URL Versioning**: `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/` for major changes
- **Header Versioning**: `Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=1` for minor changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility for at least 2 major versions

### Breaking Change Process
1. **Announcement**: 90-day notice for breaking changes
2. **Parallel Support**: Run old and new versions simultaneously
3. **Migration Guide**: Provide detailed migration documentation
4. **Deprecation**: Clear deprecation timeline and sunset dates

### Contract Monitoring
- **API Analytics**: Track usage patterns and endpoint performance
- **Error Monitoring**: Monitor error rates and patterns
- **Version Adoption**: Track migration progress across client applications

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Schema evolution breaking clients | High | Medium | Strict backward compatibility testing |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Low | Load testing and performance monitoring |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Regular security audits and automated scanning |

### Operational Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| API downtime affecting multiple services | High | Low | Circuit breaker pattern and fallback mechanisms |
| Rate limiting blocking legitimate users | Medium | Medium | Dynamic rate limiting and user feedback |
| Contract drift between teams | Medium | Medium | Automated contract validation in CI/CD |

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: 95th percentile < 200ms for GET endpoints
- **Throughput**: Support 1000 RPS per endpoint
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA

### Quality Metrics
- **Error Rate**: < 1% for 4xx errors, < 0.1% for 5xx errors
- **Test Coverage**: > 90% for contract-related code
- **Documentation**: 100% of endpoints documented with examples

### Adoption Metrics
- **Client Integration**: Track number of clients using the contract
- **Version Migration**: Monitor adoption rate of new contract versions
- **Developer Experience**: Survey satisfaction with contract usability
